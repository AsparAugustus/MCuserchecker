# MCuserchecker
Checks a fixed array of usernames and return whether if they are still active accounts.

checkuseroffline is fully functional, returns a list of active and inactive MC accounts in separate tables with console.table.

checkuseronline relies on express to render a list of the data instead. It is still currently in development.
